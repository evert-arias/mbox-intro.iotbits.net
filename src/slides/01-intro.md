# ModbusBox

Connecting industrial grade devices to the cloud.

---

In the middle of an era in which the IoT world has become very popular 
and it is increasingly necessary to monitor and control our devices from the Internet, 
we have developed ModbusBox, the best and most effective way to monitor and control virtually 
any equipment that communicates through Modbus RTU from any cloud platform that uses MQTT 
as its communication protocol.

# Device Overview

ModbusBox connects modbus slaves to the cloud. Its firmware, being in charge of reading all the slaves connected to it, not only does a great job polling data from modbus slaves and sending them to the cloud through MQTT, but also makes the process steady and easy to configure and monitor.

# Main Features

* Wi-Fi Ready
* Embedded Web-UI for easy installation and maintenance
* Uses a JSON file as manifest to easily add new modbus slaves
