# Manifest File
A key factor that makes ModbusBox flexible is its manifest file that is available to the user exposed in the file system system.
This manifest file is in JSON format and can be downloaded and uploaded from the Web-UI. It is possible to modify the registers and functions of each of the slaves included in ModbusBox by default as well as add new slaves following the instructions provided in the official documentation or using our Manifest Editor web app.
